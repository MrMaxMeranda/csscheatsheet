CSS Cheat Sheet

This list is originally a "copy" (though re-typed) from:

https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/css3-cheat-sheet/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf

This reference is formatted in a way that I can write it (with real pencil) into my A5 textbook.

I am tired of "1-2-3 follow me" courses that "teach you css" and you end without learning a darn thing. So I am taking matters seriously into my own hands and writing my own. I am using
