CSS Cheat Sheet

This list is originally a "copy" (though re-typed) from:

https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/css3-cheat-sheet/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf

So, the problem with the list is that it is incomplete, horribly full of mistakes (or was full of horrible mistakes?), and I think that I would also prefer a list that has supported CSS, not out-of-date attributes and keywords.

This reference is formatted in a way that I can write it (with real pencil) into my A5 textbook.

The purpose of this reference is to help me get through using CSS effectively. It's often hard to use a feature of something if you don't even know it exists!

I am tired of "1-2-3 follow me" courses that "teach you css" and you end without learning a darn thing. So I am taking matters seriously into my own hands and writing my own. I am using

as a reference for amendments and revisions. And I HOPE that I don't borrow mistakes from them that have yet to be amended >:(

One of the most important things about writing a CSS cheatsheet is that you need a syntax system. CSS is not so straight-forward that you can have a keyword with a 'this' or 'that' property. If it did, it would be a lot simpler, and more people would be able to master it, no doubt. However, because some keywords have 'this OR that' and 'this AND that' values, a cheatsheet is much much harder to write.* I believe that this is why there is a lack of cheatsheets out there; they are too hard to write would some syntax system.

(* English pronunciation is like that a lot of the time in regards to the phonetic symbols for pronunciation. English words do not all follow the same rules. For example, take the words 'one' and 'won' or 'bow' as in stoop, and 'bow' as in thing that shoots arrows. CSS can be regarded, in some ways, 'chaotic' as the English language.)
