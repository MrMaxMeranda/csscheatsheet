CSS Cheat Sheet

This list is originally a "copy" (though re-typed) from:

https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/css3-cheat-sheet/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf

So, the problem with the list is that it is incomplete, horribly full of mistakes (or was full of horrible mistakes?), and I think that I would also prefer a list that has supported CSS, not out-of-date attributes and keywords.

This reference is formatted in a way that I can write it (with real pencil) into my A5 textbook.

The purpose of this reference is to help me get through using CSS effectively. It's often hard to use a feature of something if you don't even know it exists!

I am tired of "1-2-3 follow me" courses that "teach you css" and you end without learning a darn thing. So I am taking matters seriously into my own hands and writing my own. I am using

as a reference for amendments and revisions. And I HOPE that I don't borrow mistakes from them that have yet to be amended >:(
